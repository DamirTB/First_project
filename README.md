# 1 step
Create a virtual environment in cmd by typing the command:

```
py -3 -m venv env
```
Instead of writing `env` you can choose any name, it's up to you.

# 2 step
Activate your virtual environment by typing the command `env\Scripts\activate`

# 3 step
Type those commands below in order to work with modules

```sh
pip install flask-sqlalchemy

pip install WTForms

pip install Flask-CLI # This one you need to activate your flask shell
```

# 4 step

mydb.create_all()

exit()
```
